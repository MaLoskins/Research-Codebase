Okay, let's break down these results for your TGN model, focusing on how they reflect its unique operational characteristics.

Interpretation of TGN Performance on PHEME Event Streams

The evaluation of the Temporal Graph Network (TGN) model, using a fixed set of hyperparameters (lr=0.001, memory_dim=256, time_dim=128, embedding_dim=256, dropout_rate=0.15, projector_dropout_rate=0.2, grad_clip_norm=2.0, batch_size=256, project_features=True, use_layernorm=True, leaky_relu_slope=0.1), across five distinct PHEME event streams reveals significant performance variability, a key aspect to consider when interpreting TGNs. The average Test F1-score across events was 0.744, with an average Test Accuracy of 0.790 (see aggregated_results_report.md). However, this aggregate masks important event-specific behaviors crucial for understanding the TGN's adaptability and limitations.

Key Observations:

Event-Specific Performance Profiles (Summary Bar Charts & MD Table):

The TGN demonstrated strong performance on ottawashooting (Test F1: 0.925, Test Acc: 0.932) and ferguson (Test F1: 0.832, Test Acc: 0.874). This suggests that the model's architecture and the chosen hyperparameters were well-suited to capture the temporal dynamics and evolving node interactions within these particular rumor cascades.

Conversely, performance was notably lower for sydneysiege (Test F1: 0.570, Test Acc: 0.681) and charliehebdo (Test F1: 0.590, Test Acc: 0.716). This disparity highlights a core characteristic of TGNs: their performance can be highly sensitive to the specific nature of the event stream. Factors such as the density of interactions, the rate of new information, the structural properties of the cascade, and the signal-to-noise ratio within the event features likely contribute to these differences.

germanwings-crash (Test F1: 0.805, Test Acc: 0.746) presented an intermediate performance level.

Insight for TGNs: Unlike static GNNs that process a single graph snapshot, TGNs continuously update node memories based on event sequences. If the "grammar" of events (how information flows and nodes interact over time) differs significantly between datasets (PHEME events), a single set of HPs for memory, time encoding, and message aggregation might not be universally optimal. The bar charts vividly illustrate this.

Learning Dynamics and Convergence (Epoch-wise Trends & Scatter Plot):

Varied Convergence Speed: The "Best Validation F1 vs. Optimal Epoch" scatter plot shows distinct learning trajectories.

germanwings-crash achieved its best validation F1-score (~0.82) very early, at epoch 3. This indicates that the TGN could quickly learn discriminative patterns for this event.

sydneysiege also peaked early (epoch 4) but at a lower validation F1 (~0.67).

In contrast, high-performing events like ottawashooting (Val F1 ~0.95 at epoch 21) and ferguson (Val F1 ~0.89 at epoch 24) required significantly more epochs (event processing) to reach their peak. This suggests these events might have more complex or longer-range temporal dependencies that the TGN gradually learns by processing more of the event stream.

Epoch-wise Performance Stability (Line Graphs):

For ottawashooting and ferguson, the epoch-wise test metrics (solid lines) generally track or closely follow their validation counterparts (dotted lines) after an initial learning phase, indicating good generalization and stable learning once the model has processed sufficient temporal context.

For charliehebdo and sydneysiege, the test performance plateaus at a lower level. The charliehebdo event shows a more pronounced gap between validation and test F1 in later epochs, suggesting the model might be slightly overfitting to the validation sequence for that specific event, even though the final reported metrics are from the best validation epoch.

The training loss consistently decreases across all events, as expected.

Insight for TGNs: The "memory" component of TGNs evolves with each processed event batch. The epoch trends show how this evolving memory translates to predictive performance over time. Some event streams might allow the memory to quickly stabilize into a useful state, while others require more "experience" (epochs/events) for the memory to capture relevant long-term patterns. The scatter plot effectively summarizes when this "optimal memory state" (for validation) is achieved.

Metric-Specific Behavior (MD Table & Epoch-wise Trends):

A critical observation is the performance of charliehebdo: Test Recall is very high (0.961), but Test Precision is very low (0.426). The epoch-wise Precision plot for charliehebdo would also reflect this lower precision throughout training compared to other metrics. This indicates the model, for this event, correctly identifies most true rumors but at the cost of misclassifying many non-rumors as rumors.

Other events like ottawashooting show a much better balance between precision and recall.

Insight for TGNs: The TGN's message passing and memory update functions might, under these fixed HPs, create representations for charliehebdo that are sensitive to rumor-like patterns but not specific enough to distinguish them well from non-rumors. This could be due to the nature of features or the temporal interaction patterns in that event.

Connecting to TGN's "Eccentricity":

Continuous Learning & Memory: The plots collectively illustrate the outcome of TGN's continuous learning process. The epoch-wise trends, especially for test metrics, are vital as they show how the model's generalization capability evolves as its memory is updated through the training event sequence. This is different from static GNNs where training epochs refine parameters on a fixed graph. Here, epochs mean processing more of the temporal data stream.

Sensitivity to Temporal Data Characteristics: The significant variance in performance and learning speed across different PHEME events (which are themselves distinct temporal graphs) is a hallmark of TGN evaluation. A fixed TGN architecture and HPs will interact differently with event streams that have varying velocities, densities, or structural evolution patterns.

Interpreting "Best Epoch": For a TGN, the "best epoch" not only signifies optimal parameter tuning but also the point in the event stream processing where the model's memory and learned temporal functions achieved the best generalization on the validation set for that specific event stream's history up to that point.

Conclusion for Results Section:

The TGN model, when trained with a general set of hyperparameters, exhibits a strong dependency on the specific characteristics of the input event stream. While achieving excellent performance on events like ottawashooting and ferguson, its effectiveness diminishes for others such as sydneysiege and charliehebdo. The learning trajectories, captured by epoch-wise metrics and the "Best Validation F1 vs. Optimal Epoch" plot, further reveal that different events require varying amounts of temporal context (epochs of event processing) for the TGN to reach its optimal predictive state. For instance, germanwings-crash converged quickly, while ottawashooting benefited from more extensive processing of its event sequence. Notably, for certain events like charliehebdo, the model struggled with precision despite high recall, indicating challenges in fine-grained discrimination.

These findings underscore that while TGNs offer a powerful framework for dynamic graphs, their performance with fixed hyperparameters is not uniform across diverse temporal datasets. The "eccentricity" of TGNs lies in this deep interplay between their evolving memory states and the unique temporal signature of each event stream, making event-specific analysis and potentially adaptive hyperparameter strategies crucial for robust real-world application. The provided visualizations offer a comprehensive view of these dynamics, moving beyond single-point performance metrics to illustrate the learning process itself.
